BestCars Inc. Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the BestCars Inc. data analysis project. This exciting project explores a dataset of used vehicles with the aim of gaining valuable insights for decision-making. As a data analyst and data scientist, my goal is to provide relevant information to enhance the management of BestCars Inc.'s vehicle fleet.

Project Contents:

Jupyter Notebook: The project includes a Jupyter Notebook named "BestCarsInc.ipynb," which provides a detailed overview of all stages of data analysis, from data cleaning to price prediction.

HTML Version: In addition to the Jupyter Notebook file, I have generated an HTML version for easy viewing.

Explanatory Video: For a comprehensive understanding of the project, I have created an explanatory video summarizing key highlights and conclusions.

CSV File: The original dataset named "vehicles.csv" is available for download and reference.

Txt File with Incident Log and Lessons Learned

This project focuses on data exploration, data cleaning, outlier detection, vehicle price prediction, and strategic decision-making for BestCars Inc.'s vehicle fleet management.
